# Getting Started with Hi Recipes

- Click on "Hi Recipes" at the top left to return to the main page
- Clicking on a recipe allows it to be added to or deleted from the wishlist
- Clicking on the small cross in each recipe insert removes the recipe from the list
- By clicking on "wishlist" at the top right of the main page, you can open a popup to display and manage the deletion of recipes from the wishlist section
- By clicking on "admin" at the top right of the main page, you will be redirected to the admin panel where you can edit and delete recipes
- Still on the admin panel, you can add a recipe by clicking on "add a recipe" (vertical image format and URL => https://unsplash.com/fr/photos/awj7sRviVXo)
- In the "Recipes list" section, you can edit or delete a recipe
- The empty "Users" section of the admin panel is currently only available as an example
- If no more recipes are stored on the application, a reset button will allow you to reset the application
